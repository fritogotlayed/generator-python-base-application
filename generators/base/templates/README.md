# Getting Started
* `make setup` will destroy and recreate the virtual environment then install all dependencies
* Optionally you may `. ./.venv/bin/activate` to activate your virtual environment so invoke things outside of the Makefile.
* Optionally you may `make dev-install` after activating your virtual environment to use `frt` from the terminal
